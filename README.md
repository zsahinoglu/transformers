# Transformers Project (minimal skeleton)

This repository has been initialized with a minimal skeleton.

Files added:

- `.gitignore` — sensible ignores for common environments
- `.gitkeep` — placeholder to keep the repo directory tracked while empty

Next steps:

- Add your project files (source code, tests, docs).
- If you want a specific scaffold (Python package, Node app, VS Code extension), tell me and I can add it.

To get started locally:

```bash
# clone the repo (if not already), then add files and commit
git status
```

# Transformers Project (minimal skeleton)

Included files:

- `README.md` — this file
- `.gitignore` — common ignores
- `.gitkeep` — placeholder so the empty directory remains in git

Next steps:

- Add your project files (source code, tests, docs) and commit.
- If you want a specific scaffold (Python package, Node app, VS Code extension), tell me and I can add it.
